When the player is ready, the game starts. The game has 10 levels and each level has three rounds. when a player goes forward in the game, it becomes difficult.
In a game, the Memory board shows a color sequence using LEDs and the player has to remember the exact sequence and press relevant buttons according to the sequence.
If he is not able to press exact sequence during 3 attempts he loses and losing music will appear. If he can press exact sequence during 3 attempts winning music will
appear and winning sequence will appear and he will go to the next round /level.
